Welcome to the github pages of the FeTS 2021 challenge! Here you can find details on the challenge rules and submission instructions for the two tasks.
I think we should look for another theme, preferably one that has a "menu" at the top, so that participants can navigate the site better.

Content:
- Home page with abstract and introduction of tasks
- Important dates (if not included in home page)
- Tasks (if not included in home page)
- Organizing team, sponsors, links etc. (if not included in home page)
- News (if not included in home page)
- Data description
- Evaluation
- Code, Rules, Registration and Submission -> for participants
- Results
- FAQs
- Contact, Forum
