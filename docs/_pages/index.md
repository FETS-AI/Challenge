**Welcome to the FeTS 2021 Challenge!**

**The first Computational Competition on Federated Learning.**

The FeTS 2021 challenge focuses on federated learning and robustness to distribution shifts between medical institutions for the task of brain tumor segmentation. For those of you who previously participated in the BraTS challenge, it is worth noting that the FeTS Challenge will be different in that:

1. the MRI dataset are provided together with their source information.
2. your submission for evaluation requires your code instead of your predicted segmentations, as we would need to run your method in unseen data that reside on collaborating institutions across the globe.

These webpages contain instructions relating to data and participation details for each task, as well as additional information on implementation and requirement specifications for each particular task to help you get started.

Thanks again for your interest in this yearâ€™s FeTS Challenge, and we look forward to your participation.

Best wishes,

The FeTS 2021 organizing committee.
