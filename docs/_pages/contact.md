There are two channels of communication for information related to the MICCAI FeTS 2021 challenge:

- Either use the [discussion forum](https://github.com/FETS-AI/Challenge/discussions), where you can get help from the organizers and other participants, or,
- if you do not want to discuss your issue publicly, send us an email to: [challenge@fets.ai](mailto:challenge@fets.ai)
