## What is the main website for the challenge?

You are on the main website right now. Additionally, participants may follow the our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/FeTS_Challenge) for updates and visit the [challenge repo](https://github.com/FETS-AI/Challenge).

## How do I register for the challenge?

This is described on the [participation page](participate.md/#registration-and-data-access).

## How do I obtain the data for the challenge?

This is described on the [participation page](participate.md/#registration-and-data-access).

## Can I use additional data for model development?

No. Participants are NOT allowed to use additional public and/or private data (from their own institutions) for extending the provided data. Similarly, using models that were pretrained on such datasets is NOT allowed. This is due to our intentions to provide a fair comparison among the participating methods.

## What is the data citation?

Please cite the following papers when using data from this challenge:
