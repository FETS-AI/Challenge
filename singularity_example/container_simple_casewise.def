# General TODOs:
# - The tmpfs when using writable-tmpfs seems to be very small. Not sure how to fix it, here are some ideas: 
#   https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/issues/5718
#   https://groups.google.com/a/lbl.gov/g/singularity/c/eq-tLo2SewM
#   update 21/04/29: I'm not sure any more where this causes a problem. My container does not need the tmpfs.
# - bootstrap image: Could there be problems with the nvidia driver? 
#   From: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.04-py3 worked but I'm not sure if this was just "luck". Find out how gpu support works!
#   -> May have to specify minimum driver version as "HW requirement"

Bootstrap: docker

    This singularity container predicts segmentations on the images in the input folder (first argument)
    and saves them to the output folder (second argument). It uses thresholding as a dummy model.
