# Task 2: Generalization "in the wild"

This tasks focuses on segmentation methods that can learn from multi-institutional datasets how to be robust to cross-institution distribution shifts at test-time, effectively solving a domain generalization problem. In this repository, you can find information on the container submission and ranking for task 2 of the FeTS challenge 2021. We provide:

- [MLCube (docker) template](mlcubes/model): This is a guide how to build a container submission. For more details on how to submit to task 2 of the FeTS challenge 2022, see the [challenge website](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn28546456/wiki/617255).
- Code that is used to compute the final [ranking](ranking)

The requirements of these components are described in the readme files of the respective folders.
